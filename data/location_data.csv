48,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

127,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

189,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day.

201,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible


Anyways what I feel is: depressed,anxious,outcasted,underservint of love, stupid,ugly,pathetic,useless, and etc.

400,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

479,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

541,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day.

553,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

831,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

892,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

904,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

1245,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

1257,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

1600,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

1609,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",6,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

1953,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

1962,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",3,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

2305,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

2315,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",6,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

2657,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

2667,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,2,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

3009,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day.

3019,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",3,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

3363,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

3373,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

3717,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

3727,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",3,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

4070,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

4080,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

4424,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

4434,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",3,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

4778,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

4788,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",3,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

5131,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

5141,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Im 21 years old, im from Venezuela living in FL, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in high school but started to actually affect after I came to the states, besides everything I've gone thru adapting myself to this country and try to socialize on a 2nd lenguage I was/am struggling about my identity and who I am.


I'm Gay and my family is condervative Christian... I think y'all know what's coming... anyways, my mom and sister knows im gay and they simply dont accept it, I've tried to educate them about it and show them how i feel but they simply won't change their point of view.


Everyday I gotta live with these people that show gratitud to a God that has hurt me since my childhood, i have many incesurities about my body and even personality, i cant find love i struggle making friends and not too long ago i ended up in a psych ward, I've been on therapy and meds for a long time already and i guess it has worked but not much.


Honestly everyday i feel like im a mistake that I shouldn't have existes, where I was born the family i live with like everything is just so wrong, I've always had to convincente myself is ok to be who I am but sometimes the thought of dying just comes over me and it seems like the best option. During the day i have thes elittle burdts of energy where I ltrlly say f everyone and im just gonna be me and live and then im this scared kid that cant even go out of the house without swearing cold or feeling uncomfortable.

I've done the typical things to make my struggle less severe but I just can't escape from my reality, maybe im never gonna be able to move out or live like a productive adult, I'll never be able to get better physically and not struggle financially, I'll never be able to feel supported amd actually understood by my family.

Honestly sometimes I've been about to just end with everything but I just get scared ca of this trauma i have that if I kill myself im going to hell and even if I sont believe it i have this voice in my brain that reminds everything i was taught and just reassures me that there's no place for me in this world, that I shouldn't have been born and i just should shoot myself in the head.


I know my way of waiting stuff sucks but please be paciente with me this is my 2nd lenguage and I have tons of ideas and historias and im trying to make everything as short as possible

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

5442,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options.

""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

5558,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day.

I wish I could just talk to those around me without causing them to tiptoe around me whether they realise they're doing it or not.

I feel I can't tell most (basically all) of my friends because I'm scared they won't talk to me and stuff and we barely talk as it is.

I only really talk to two friends, one who lives too far away and another who I don't ask to hangout with enough. The other friends.. we just barely message eachother, most of them are still in school too so are busy during the week. Either last year of school or are in college.

I'm doing nothing, sat at home because I didn't get the grades for the course I wanted to do at college even though they said I didn't need them for that course and then when I went to do the trial start thingy for ITEC they didn't want me triggering others there so didn't let me do the trial start thing.

I've helped my dad a few times and that's about it.

I feel so far behind everyone I know because they have jobs, go to school or college, clearly more mature than me and just.. so much further ahead.

Here I am, almost an adult, sat at home, still acting like a child, doesn't know how to do anything, doesn't even know how to cook almost anything except pasta, pancakes (sort of) and toast and that might be about it if you don't include noodles (the packets and pots). Oh and sort of pizza and chips and nuggets and now gravy.. sort of. Mostly very simple stuff.

When I'm with family I can't even go into shops alone because I'm too scared.

I'm scared my ex is gonna go tell my friends about stuff I've said and done and also make stuff up about me to get them all to hate me. The stuff I'm aware I've said that aren't nice I feel horrible for, even after apologising.

He knows I barely have friends and have always had trouble making friends and stuff.. I don't want to be alone again, I can't be but.. I'm not alone am I? I have my family and my two friends but.. I won't always have them. I hate this so much.

I feel like I can't trust anything anyone says when it involves my ex.

I feel like I'm drowning in these fucking feelings and I can't take anymore fucking shit in my fucking life!!!! I JUST GOT FUCKING DONE WITH THE REST OF IT I DON'T NEED MORE!! UNLESS THAT WAS JUST THE QUIET BEFORE THE STORM GETS WORSE!?

WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAVE TO FUCKING HAPPEN!?

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET ME HAVE FUCKING FRIENDS HUH!? IF THERE'S ANYONE FUCKING OUT THERE, WHY WON'T YOU JUST LET ME BE HAPPY AND HAVE FRIENDS INSTEAD OF THIS FUCKING ANXIETY AND ALL THIS OTHER SHIT HUH!?

THIS FUCKING AUTISM ISN'T HELPING WITH GETTING OTHERS TO TREAT ME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!!!

HAVEN'T YOU PUNISHED US ENOUGH!? WHAT ARE YOU EVEN PUNISHING US FOR!? HM!? CAUSING STUFF WE CAN'T FIX!? FOR THE WARS AND FIGHTING!? FOR THE POLUTION!? FOR EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO FUCKING FIX!? IF YOU CREATED US THEN FUCKING FIX THE PROBLEMS YOU CREATED!!

PLEASE!!!! WE ARE FUCKING TIRED OF FIGHTING!! WE ARE TIRED OF THE FIGHTING, OF THE FEAR, OF THE POLUTION, POISON AND JUST EVERYTHING THAT'S CORRUPT IN THIS FUCKING WORLD!!! 

OR ARE YOU JUST PUTTING YOUR PAIN ONTO US!? JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH YOUR PAIN DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD DEAL WITH IT FOR YOU, IT'LL ALL JUST COME BACK AROUND TO YOU IN THE END!!!

I'm sick and tired of everyone and this fucking world.. I just want to go in the middle of nowhere and build a small hut and live in the wild but I can't because of stupid fucking laws and money and everything we've created. Only we limit ourselves.

We put these barriers on ourselves. We have no freedom because of ourselves, even if we think we have freedom, we don't. What even is the meaning of freedom?

I just want all of this shit to be over but whenever I think it is over.. something else pops up right in my face.

I just want to be a kid again, going on walks with my family and camping, seeing the world through those eyes.. it was huge and magical.. but now.. it's dim and it's magic is dying. I'm fucking dying here. I can't keep doing this.

But dying is easy and living is hard.

Maybe one day I can be the kid again, maybe on this trip with my family.. except.. my older brother won't be there I'm pretty sure.

5575,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

5678,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine. It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post.

5934,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this).

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

6016,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

The Question i have here is: has someone the same kind of problem..

6133,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

6138,depression,1jd1jff,2025-03-17 01:41:03,"I just want to be treated normally, not like I'm a fragile eggshell.

I wish I could just talk to those around me without causing them to tiptoe around me whether they realise they're doing it or not.

I feel I can't tell most (basically all) of my friends because I'm scared they won't talk to me and stuff and we barely talk as it is.

I only really talk to two friends, one who lives too far away and another who I don't ask to hangout with enough. The other friends.. we just barely message eachother, most of them are still in school too so are busy during the week. Either last year of school or are in college.

I'm doing nothing, sat at home because I didn't get the grades for the course I wanted to do at college even though they said I didn't need them for that course and then when I went to do the trial start thingy for ITEC they didn't want me triggering others there so didn't let me do the trial start thing.

I've helped my dad a few times and that's about it.

I feel so far behind everyone I know because they have jobs, go to school or college, clearly more mature than me and just.. so much further ahead.

Here I am, almost an adult, sat at home, still acting like a child, doesn't know how to do anything, doesn't even know how to cook almost anything except pasta, pancakes (sort of) and toast and that might be about it if you don't include noodles (the packets and pots). Oh and sort of pizza and chips and nuggets and now gravy.. sort of. Mostly very simple stuff.

When I'm with family I can't even go into shops alone because I'm too scared.

I'm scared my ex is gonna go tell my friends about stuff I've said and done and also make stuff up about me to get them all to hate me. The stuff I'm aware I've said that aren't nice I feel horrible for, even after apologising.

He knows I barely have friends and have always had trouble making friends and stuff.. I don't want to be alone again, I can't be but.. I'm not alone am I? I have my family and my two friends but.. I won't always have them. I hate this so much.

I feel like I can't trust anything anyone says when it involves my ex.

I feel like I'm drowning in these fucking feelings and I can't take anymore fucking shit in my fucking life!!!! I JUST GOT FUCKING DONE WITH THE REST OF IT I DON'T NEED MORE!! UNLESS THAT WAS JUST THE QUIET BEFORE THE STORM GETS WORSE!?

WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAVE TO FUCKING HAPPEN!?

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET ME HAVE FUCKING FRIENDS HUH!? IF THERE'S ANYONE FUCKING OUT THERE, WHY WON'T YOU JUST LET ME BE HAPPY AND HAVE FRIENDS INSTEAD OF THIS FUCKING ANXIETY AND ALL THIS OTHER SHIT HUH!?

THIS FUCKING AUTISM ISN'T HELPING WITH GETTING OTHERS TO TREAT ME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!!!

HAVEN'T YOU PUNISHED US ENOUGH!? WHAT ARE YOU EVEN PUNISHING US FOR!? HM!? CAUSING STUFF WE CAN'T FIX!? FOR THE WARS AND FIGHTING!? FOR THE POLUTION!? FOR EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO FUCKING FIX!? IF YOU CREATED US THEN FUCKING FIX THE PROBLEMS YOU CREATED!!

PLEASE!!!! WE ARE FUCKING TIRED OF FIGHTING!! WE ARE TIRED OF THE FIGHTING, OF THE FEAR, OF THE POLUTION, POISON AND JUST EVERYTHING THAT'S CORRUPT IN THIS FUCKING WORLD!!! 

OR ARE YOU JUST PUTTING YOUR PAIN ONTO US!? JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH YOUR PAIN DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD DEAL WITH IT FOR YOU, IT'LL ALL JUST COME BACK AROUND TO YOU IN THE END!!!

I'm sick and tired of everyone and this fucking world.. I just want to go in the middle of nowhere and build a small hut and live in the wild but I can't because of stupid fucking laws and money and everything we've created. Only we limit ourselves.

We put these barriers on ourselves. We have no freedom because of ourselves, even if we think we have freedom, we don't. What even is the meaning of freedom?

I just want all of this shit to be over but whenever I think it is over.. something else pops up right in my face.

I just want to be a kid again, going on walks with my family and camping, seeing the world through those eyes.. it was huge and magical.. but now.. it's dim and it's magic is dying. I'm fucking dying here. I can't keep doing this.

But dying is easy and living is hard.

Maybe one day I can be the kid again, maybe on this trip with my family.. except.. my older brother won't be there I'm pretty sure.

6150,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

6591,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

6709,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

6714,depression,1jd1jff,2025-03-17 01:41:03,"I just want to be treated normally, not like I'm a fragile eggshell.

I wish I could just talk to those around me without causing them to tiptoe around me whether they realise they're doing it or not.

I feel I can't tell most (basically all) of my friends because I'm scared they won't talk to me and stuff and we barely talk as it is.

I only really talk to two friends, one who lives too far away and another who I don't ask to hangout with enough. The other friends.. we just barely message eachother, most of them are still in school too so are busy during the week. Either last year of school or are in college.

I'm doing nothing, sat at home because I didn't get the grades for the course I wanted to do at college even though they said I didn't need them for that course and then when I went to do the trial start thingy for ITEC they didn't want me triggering others there so didn't let me do the trial start thing.

I've helped my dad a few times and that's about it.

I feel so far behind everyone I know because they have jobs, go to school or college, clearly more mature than me and just.. so much further ahead.

Here I am, almost an adult, sat at home, still acting like a child, doesn't know how to do anything, doesn't even know how to cook almost anything except pasta, pancakes (sort of) and toast and that might be about it if you don't include noodles (the packets and pots). Oh and sort of pizza and chips and nuggets and now gravy.. sort of. Mostly very simple stuff.

When I'm with family I can't even go into shops alone because I'm too scared.

I'm scared my ex is gonna go tell my friends about stuff I've said and done and also make stuff up about me to get them all to hate me. The stuff I'm aware I've said that aren't nice I feel horrible for, even after apologising.

He knows I barely have friends and have always had trouble making friends and stuff.. I don't want to be alone again, I can't be but.. I'm not alone am I? I have my family and my two friends but.. I won't always have them. I hate this so much.

I feel like I can't trust anything anyone says when it involves my ex.

I feel like I'm drowning in these fucking feelings and I can't take anymore fucking shit in my fucking life!!!! I JUST GOT FUCKING DONE WITH THE REST OF IT I DON'T NEED MORE!! UNLESS THAT WAS JUST THE QUIET BEFORE THE STORM GETS WORSE!?

WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAVE TO FUCKING HAPPEN!?

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET ME HAVE FUCKING FRIENDS HUH!? IF THERE'S ANYONE FUCKING OUT THERE, WHY WON'T YOU JUST LET ME BE HAPPY AND HAVE FRIENDS INSTEAD OF THIS FUCKING ANXIETY AND ALL THIS OTHER SHIT HUH!?

THIS FUCKING AUTISM ISN'T HELPING WITH GETTING OTHERS TO TREAT ME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!!!

HAVEN'T YOU PUNISHED US ENOUGH!? WHAT ARE YOU EVEN PUNISHING US FOR!? HM!? CAUSING STUFF WE CAN'T FIX!? FOR THE WARS AND FIGHTING!? FOR THE POLUTION!? FOR EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO FUCKING FIX!? IF YOU CREATED US THEN FUCKING FIX THE PROBLEMS YOU CREATED!!

PLEASE!!!! WE ARE FUCKING TIRED OF FIGHTING!! WE ARE TIRED OF THE FIGHTING, OF THE FEAR, OF THE POLUTION, POISON AND JUST EVERYTHING THAT'S CORRUPT IN THIS FUCKING WORLD!!! 

OR ARE YOU JUST PUTTING YOUR PAIN ONTO US!? JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH YOUR PAIN DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD DEAL WITH IT FOR YOU, IT'LL ALL JUST COME BACK AROUND TO YOU IN THE END!!!

I'm sick and tired of everyone and this fucking world.. I just want to go in the middle of nowhere and build a small hut and live in the wild but I can't because of stupid fucking laws and money and everything we've created. Only we limit ourselves.

We put these barriers on ourselves. We have no freedom because of ourselves, even if we think we have freedom, we don't. What even is the meaning of freedom?

I just want all of this shit to be over but whenever I think it is over.. something else pops up right in my face.

I just want to be a kid again, going on walks with my family and camping, seeing the world through those eyes.. it was huge and magical.. but now.. it's dim and it's magic is dying. I'm fucking dying here. I can't keep doing this.

But dying is easy and living is hard.

6727,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

7166,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

7203,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

7285,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

7302,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",6,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

7741,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

7778,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options.

""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

7860,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

7877,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

8234,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

8316,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

8436,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

8452,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",6,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

8554,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine. It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post. 

I have more blood tests coming and another ekg coming up in a few days and I’ve always been trying to see a psychiatrist, it’s just taking a long time. I’m in the uk and yeahh…they’re very slow 😩 I am on anxiety medication too!

8809,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this).

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

8892,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"".

They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

9027,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

9129,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine. It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

9467,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

9505,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"".

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

The Question i have here is: has someone the same kind of problem..

9587,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

9602,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better?

9678,anxiety,1jd8eo2,2025-03-17 09:12:31,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills .

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

10042,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

The Question i have here is: has someone the same kind of problem..

10162,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

10177,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

10616,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

10736,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

10750,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,3,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

10853,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine. It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post. 

I have more blood tests coming and another ekg coming up in a few days and I’ve always been trying to see a psychiatrist, it’s just taking a long time. I’m in the uk and yeahh…they’re very slow 😩 I am on anxiety medication too! 

My questions are this…is it possible for anxiety to like…make me feel things even if I don’t actively feel anxious? And what are some things I can do to maybe try calm my health anxiety?

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

i am in my late teens and I feel like I have totally fuckd up my life.. it's not like I am not trying.. it's been more than 2 years now... I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME? WILL I EVER BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH ANYONE OR LOVE ANYONE? WILL I REALLY END UP LIKE ANY OTHER STRUGGLING ELDER ON STREET WHO PUT BEING ALIVE BEFORE THEIR DREAMS?

I seem to be the kind of people that overcomplicates way too much (and sometimes oversimplify what I shouldn't), and always have everything on my mind, and I'm really unable to establish priorities in my life

That's starting to take its toll on my relationship and daily life, as I'm always tired, and my brain never slows down

Any tips on how to best fix that?

Like, do I start doing meditation, write a journal, or some other things?

11189,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

11309,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

11323,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,4,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

11702,mentalhealth,1jdasrh,2025-03-17 11:52:19,"I am in the UK. GP fobbed me off and I don't know what to do next

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

i am in my late teens and I feel like I have totally fuckd up my life.. it's not like I am not trying.. it's been more than 2 years now... I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME? WILL I EVER BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH ANYONE OR LOVE ANYONE? WILL I REALLY END UP LIKE ANY OTHER STRUGGLING ELDER ON STREET WHO PUT BEING ALIVE BEFORE THEIR DREAMS?

11762,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

11801,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

11883,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

11897,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",3,4,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

12337,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options.

""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

12458,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

12472,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",5,4,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

12829,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself..

12910,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

13031,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK.

13045,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",6,4,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

13148,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine.

13401,mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,2025-03-17 09:10:12,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

I contacted my GP on Friday (through their online consult feature) as I have been struggling with low mood, lack of motivation and self sabotaging behaviours for a few months now. They replied giving me an appointment with a ""mental health facilitator"" in 3 weeks time.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this).

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

13482,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"".

I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options.

""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

13617,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,4,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

13721,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine. It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

14053,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

14092,depression,1jdehak,2025-03-17 14:51:44,"Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"".

14156,depression,1jcwrpm,2025-03-16 21:52:02,"Hello, im Michael. 
Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

The Question i have here is: has someone the same kind of problem..

14174,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

14189,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better?

14265,anxiety,1jd8eo2,2025-03-17 09:12:31,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months .

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated).

I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

14625,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

The Question i have here is: has someone the same kind of problem..

14745,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

14760,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better? Or am I the one at fault here?",4,4,str,husband meet year ago marry year fall deeply love feel like perfect dream perfect see everything match much common similar aspiration life family great make

Today I woke up feeling absolutely worse so I contacted the GP again. I have been off work for the last week, can't focus on anything, and have thoughts of SH (don't think I'd act on them, I'm just frustrated). I also spoke to my partner over the weekend, who has mentioned before that he thinks I might have autism (I agree) and I mentioned to the GP today that I think I might be experiencing autistic burnout. I asked to speak to someone about this as it is impacting my work. I can't keep taking time off. I previously lost two jobs for absence due to work stress/being unable to cope with the demands of the job (looking back I identify so much of what I couldn't cope with with a potential autism diagnosis). I don't want to lose this job, if I did I'm not sure what I would do.

The GP just replied to me saying that I should contact the local mental health phone line whilst waiting for my appointment. I already contacted them on Friday and they were useless, just told me to speak to my manager at work (I have already done this). I requested from my GP to speak to someone today about getting signed off for a little bit as I think that would help and they completely disregarded this.

I feel this quickly getting worse and I need help sooner rather than later. I'm not under secondary mental health services and have read that 111 option 2 are useless for things like this.

I have the mindset of living my life to the fullest at the moment coz u don't know when u'll die.. but rn all I have is a toxic household(i love my parents and family coz they work hard for me but uk just some bitter experiences) and i am soo lonely ... like literally every other kid around my age is having atleast a little bit fun in their life as a teenager, i try to give myself reasons and explain to myself ""people have it worse than u"", ""if you do it now you will have so much fun later"", ""do it for ur parents, their reputations and the terrible things they went through"".. etc etc.. but i just can't..

I was at a really worse place(regarding my mental health).. a year ago.. but i knew that if i kept that going.. the end would be really bad(if u know, uk)... so i just uk packed up everything inside of me and started to put in little efforts and i have been doing that more often lately(tried to go on morning walks, baked stuffs for family, skincare, cleaning), but uk i just end up doing these small terrible things that just take me to an even worse place than before or something happens to me to which i just become so upset like the kind of upset that is not normal...

look i do things that can be considered as mentally ill behavior but no way i can go a therapy or anywhere coz parents and a strict household ... but uk what, whenever i ask myself.. WHY ME?.. the answer always comes back to me... i think terrible things about god and about my parents or just anyone.. i am always on screen. like 24hr.. never study(only a few days before exam) keep lying to my parents.. and keep showing everyone false dreams.. coz everytime i try to be better i get the feeling that this will be the exact moment i change and i tell everyone more about my ridiculous dreams and thoughts that i'll be rich and shit.. but tbh just 2 sec later i am totally trying to only keep myself alive.. in the end i guess it is only me who is not putting in the effort.. like not even trying .. just giving up a second later something goes wrong, i have really bad anger issues and i am so bad mannered IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?

15196,depression,1jd4q9t,2025-03-17 04:39:11,"TLDR: I (26M) had a relationship that ended absolutely horribly 5 years ago. My ex-girlfriend (21F) cheated with a much older man (35M). 5 years later, the only reason I'm still alive is I still want to go find and kill him.




Context:

Ex and I were each other’s first. Started dating in college, we were both 19.

2.5 years later, middle of covid. Ex graduates 6 months early. I still have 6 months of school left.

She is still living with her folks. I share a student apartment with 2 roomates.

Horrible job market. Ex takes a job as the night shift concierge at an apartment building downtown. I am also in a rut, unsure about my future after graduation.

I drive her to work and pick her up when I can. She usually sleeps as I drive.

Ex constantly has jet lag bc night shift. As a result, our quality time together and communication plummet. 

She has 1 singular coworker with her through her shift every night. Henceforth he will be referred to as ""G"".

● G (35M) is from Mexico, and obtained a graduate level education there. 

● G (35M) immigrated to the US and became a building maintenance worker.

● G (35M) has 2 daughters from 2 different babymamas. 

● G (35M) knows that my ex is 21 and just graduated college.

● G (35M) knows that my ex has a bf that she is in a long-term committed relationship with.

● G (35M) does not care.

Q: How do I know all about G? 
A: My ex told me. To her credit, my ex was very transparent when talking about her work life and G's flirting.

Q: Why did I not see the red flags?
A: The transparency. And as soon as I heard about G's age and prior relationships and offspring, G's status as a potential romantic rival went out the window for me.

Q: Why assume that?
A: I was young and naive.

The big picture: I study by day and sleep at night. She sleeps during the day and works at night. She has basically uninterrupted alone time with G during her shifts. 

1 month later. 
She suddenly tells me she thinks it's better for us to see other poeple. 
She said that there's nothing I can do or say to change her mind.
Does not mention G. 
I'm dumbfounded. 
I ask her why? I ask her is there another person? 
She says, ""Maybe.""

   My heart breaks.

Don't allow myself to register what happend for 12 hours.

12 hours later I break down.

Cry. Sleep. Repeat.

Drop 20lb in 1 week.

Try to respect her wish for me not to attempt to change her mind.

Can't do it.

10 days later I call her. She's bubbly.

She's fawning all over her ""new partner"".
It's only been 10 days. 

   My heart breaks.

She let's slip that they've already slept together.
It's only been 10 days.

   My heart breaks.

She says she wants us to remain friends. She say she still loves me, just not in ""that"" way.

   My heart breaks.

   She sounds so happy. 

She says that if I try to say anything to try and win her back or anything bad about her new man, she will instantly hang up.

   My heart shatters. 

   And

   An important part of me dies at that moment.

Never see her again. 

<<5 years later>>

All other aspects of my life have gradually fallen apart. Education. Career. Social life. Family. And the part of me that cared is dead and gone.


Every time I look in the mirror, all my imperfections still scream at me: ""You weren't good enough to keep her, why would any other woman want you?"" The other voice, the counter-voice, my ego, my defender, is dead and gone.


I've tried. I've had lots of dates, and a few flings. Absolutely fantastic chemistry with 2 women. Even better than with my ex. It doesn't matter. It always ends in self sabotage. I've never been able to trust enough to enter into a solid relationship again. I know that I never will. That part of me is dead and gone.


A very important part of me is missing. It's been 5 years. I don't think it's coming back. It's dead. It's gone. And along with it went all hope of finding romantic fulfillment. All hope of starting a family. All hope of leaving a legacy through children.


The only reason the rest of me is still here is to avenge the part of me that is gone. 


I have improved one singular aspect of myself in the past 5 years. I've become competent at multiple combat sports.


And so, 5 years after that relationship,
I still think about finding and killing G with my bare hands almost daily.

I don't know his personal info or address. I don't even know what he looks like.

But one day I'll see him. 

And I'll know.

I will feel him struggle. 
I will feel him thrash.
I will feel his nails digging into my forearms.
I will hear his feet helplessly flail and drum the ground. Slower every second.
I will feel him go limp.
And I will keep squeezing.

And then the rest of me can go. And we will head down to Hell together.

I know if I ever see him, this is what will happen. This homicidal-ideation has helped keep me from suicidal-ideation. This is why i can get up every morning. I still have unfinished business here. This evil, vile motivation has become my crutch.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

Im going to be next 35 Years Old. 
Im in depression since i was 15/16. And my depression got more and more Strong since the last 6 years. My Parents have accept it now more or less. Before that discussion about depression has end with ""do you not believe in God"" or ""i have not learn you more about God. I'm a bad Mother"".
My mother still believe that the answer to everything is believe in God. And I don't want to make this about religion and beliefs.

Im coming from a polish family so they really want me that I get children. Quoten from my Mother. ""If you have children, my depression will go away"". 
I'm happy more lately being alone. My last few relationships were pretty Toxic with Woman. 
I'm not the best looking guy and the last few woman seen me as a Bank/Sex Toy/spermbank than someone that has feeling and options. 

My Parnets want me to have so fast as possible that I get marry and have children. 
""You could have someone from Thailand or Belarus to marry you. The woman are great Wife"".
They are polish from the old times, so this is for them not that weird. But for me I get that feeling few times that I'm desspret to get anyone. And I don't want to date someone that kind. I have dates like that, we're the person just told me stuff like ""I like the same thing like you"" ,""I want to have children so fast as possible and being a Family"". I get that for woman is more hard than every man will ever understood this. But I'm not that desspret or want to have children in general. 
But I can't tell this my Parents. That will break them. I don't like having children or I have the time if I'm working 6 days a week(with 2 days off)  and with the burn out I had few weeks ego. I can't see myself with children or being a good parent.

The Question i have here is: has someone the same kind of problem..

15316,depression,1jd62lo,2025-03-17 06:10:03,"I am 65 years old and in my life I have attempted suicide more times than most people. I've been very close on numerous occasions and have been hospitalized more times than I want to remember and have been locked up in psych wards in some of the worse places in the United States. Dying is a lot more difficult than you might think or even want to believe. It happens, but it's not easy and this is not a how to post. This is a why you need to live post.
You have the ability to find happiness because it's out there and freely available to everyone including those of you who are down and out, broke with no skills. It's available for ugly people as well as people born with good looks. It doesn't matter. The point is it's available to everyone for free. I've been through all of those things, but I found my way out of it and you can too. It's not complicated and there are no secrets. It boils down to your own desire to be happy.
 I spent decades looking for excuses for being miserable and found way more than my share of them. I embraced them and wallowed in misery just hoping my life would end. Guess what..I'm still alive and doing alright. I'm not rich. In fact I only have about $1000 a month to get by on, but I have a roof over my head, I own a beat up old van that runs and I eat decent food. I work when I want now because of my age despite lots of health issues. I woke up one day about 20 years ago hoping to die and one thought popped into my head. I never forgot it. I'm closer to dying of plain old fashioned old age than I've ever been in my entire life. You are too and you will be tomorrow and the day after that and the next day and on and on. Every second of your life gets you a little closer to dying because everyone dies.
Back to mental health and I know there's going to be push back about this, but I have absolutely no faith in the mental health system. None whatsoever. I've been through the ringer and then some with lots of well meaning people, but they're all full of shit. Every single one of them think they have the midas touch to help, but in every single case in my life they just made things worse. Sound familiar? If so you may have experienced it too. Individual results may vary, but for me they were the most useless people I ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  To make matters worse the single largest provider of mental health services in the United States is the criminal justice system. Think about that for a second. It should tell you everything you need to know about mental health in the United States. They don't really care about you as long as they get paid and if they don't get paid they REALLY don't care about you or your problems. The absolute last place anyone who can freely get up and walk out the door should want to be is in the mental health system. It's a factory of misery and despair and little more. So where does that leave you with your problems? You'll always have problems. Everyone does and always will. But your job,  your ONLY thing that should really matter to you is finding ways to make you happy in ways that don't harm anyone. Finding happiness is a job and you are capable of finding it. If I can do it ANYONE can find happiness. Sitting around feeling sorry for you isn't going to win you any prizes, that's for damned sure, but going out of your way every day to find things that truly make you happy? You can't beat that with a stick.  I'm not talking about jumping up and down giddy, stupid happy. Just being OK today and being a bit more OK the next day and so on and just keep building on it..You're going to be OK. Hey, life's gonna suck, but you're going to be OK. Just stay as far away from those shithole psych wards as possible and avoid them like the plague and live to fight another day. And learn the most important thing, learn how to live inside your own skin. It's the only one you're ever going to get.

15329,anxiety,1jdfup3,2025-03-17 15:48:13,"My husband and I met 5 years ago and have been married for 3 years now. We fell so deeply in love and it felt like a perfect dream, we were perfect for each other, that's how we saw it. Everything matched. We had so much in common, similar aspirations in life, our families were great, we both made a great looking couple, he is so handsome, funny, smart and kind, the intimacy was amazing. I thought I was so lucky and so did he. We both were so romantic with each other - we spoke from the heart and soul and expressed our love so often. Even after marriage, things were majority of the time amazing. He was previously married for 10 years and has a 14 year old son (he got married at 19 and his family come from a war-torn country that has really affected them with trauma throughout his life, as they would go back there often, my husband was there till he was 8) - the reason for his previous marriage failing was that they grew into different people and he fell out of love half way through, they slept in different rooms for the second half of their marriage). After his marriage ended he had several casual relationships and then wanted to find love.

I suffer with anxiety and I have always had mental health issues - nothing that would affect our relationship daily, but enough that I knew I needed to be transparent about it before marriage - I told him while we were dating that suffer with anxiety and asked him if he had experience supporting someone with that in a previous relationship. He said kind of. A girl he was casually seeing had panic attacks. I asked in what way did he support - he said he comforted, listened and just helped them go through it whenever it happened. I was satisfied with that answer and didn't ask anything more. In hindsight, I should have asked ""If things got really bad with me, how would you feel etc."" to get a better idea of whether this would mean 'deal-breaker'.

My anxiety attacks got worse after marriage - I realise that I don't love myself enough, I am super needy, clingy and co-dependant, which came out when we would argue about things. He said he has always had issues with people who have mental health problems when they aren't doing enough to help themselves - he uses the term 'snowflakes' with people he considers weak. His dad has had mental issues for the last few years, only he refuses to do anything about it, saying he doesn't have a problem and insists everyone support him with everything - my husband began resenting and hating him, calling him pathetic, which I thought was harsh.

These anxiety episodes, or 'wobbles' as I call them, would almost always be on the back of an argument or fall out we would have and it would just spiral and I'd get overemotional - picture me crying for hours, begging him for comfort, to talk through it with me, sitting on the bathroom floor in the dark. I have this problem where I need to resolve something then and there, and not go to sleep until it is, I just don't respect the boundaries when he says he doesn't want to talk anymore. He would support to the best of his capacity, but eventually after a few hours he would get frustrated and tired and become toxic - just very cutthroat and rough, start shouting, saying I needed to handle this on my own. I would then get even more upset and follow him around the house, pleading him to stay with me until I felt better. I realise this isn't healthy of me and it's not fair on him, but these episodes would be every 2-3 weeks, not so often. The rest of the time I was fine. I was working on myself - understood that I had an issue, practiced reflection, introspection, took a few months of therapy etc. Then in the last year, we bought our own place (which was super stressful and a huge milestone), and the frequency of these episodes were less and less - maybe every month instead, and not as intense. I though I was doing okay, and we were happy - thought he was happy, too.

In the last few months, things have deteriorated. Last summer, he made it clearer that he no longer wanted children (I was always 50-50), and then end of September, he was a bit down after coming back from a work trip and I asked him why. He said he felt guilty - he was in London (my hometown), and thought of how I would enjoy life there so much and my mental health would be better if we lived there instead of a small town in Scotland (where I did struggle, but tried to adapt). I reassured him that it's okay and I'll be fine - I've been adapting slowly. Then he said ""Okay, but we really need to work on your mental health and lifestyle"". I got upset and suddenly started crying and said I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't like that the finger was pointing to me, when I was hoping he would be more supportive that I'm doing better. I wasn't expecting that comment. At this point he also mentioned that he has 100% decided he does not want kids - I had such an emotional reaction to this (I was mourning the option that is no longer an option) that he doesn't believe me when I say I'm still okay to not have them and also said ""I didn't want to tell you this because it would hurt you, part of the reason is also that I don't want to have kids with your health because you'd be an unfit mother"". I should also mention that I got pregnant in the first year of our marriage but I decided not to have it because I did not feel mentally, physically ready and we were broke. I know I'm not fit enough to be a mum, but it really hurt hearing that from him.

We kept talking and things escalated over the following weeks. We were arguing a lot, I cried and had break-downs a lot and he would scream and swear at me a lot. He said let's give it 3 month of me trying to improve my mental health, and if it's not working then we split up (the fact that he think I still want a baby is also on his mind). I thought it unfair to place an ultimatum on me like that, when I truly think I am not that bad to live with. I was stunned that it was causing such a problem. At this point he said he still loved me.

Forward a few weeks more and he tells me mid-argument that he's falling out of love with me and has been for the last couple of years and now only loves me 'a bit'. I was shocked because I had no idea - I thought his love was always there, I didn't see it lessening, he didn't tell me or show it. I said he should have told me sooner so I could have saved our marriage, but he said he didn't because he thought I would spiral like I'm doing now and our marriage would end and he didn't want that. He said his loved has lessened over time: ""Your mental health has impacted mine, I don't have the threshold to support you like you want me to. And it's not just that - you're overall a negative person, low-self esteem, you're not proactive about improving your health and you're lazy (commenting on a couple of boxes I hadn't unpacked since moving in). I didn't want to marry someone like that. You've not made any of your own friends here, you're not active enough, taken on new hobbies and your life revolves around me and us. It's unattractive. I don't want to be with someone with mental health issues."". Here's the thing - I heard this and it really hurt my feelings. I was holding myself accountable - yes I am somewhat lazy; I could have done more to be proactive about things, but I don't think I'm THAT lazy. I have a full-time stressful job (I earn more than him and pay for half of everything, if not a bit more); I do more in terms of house chores (he does help with the dishes, laundry, vacuuming and the car) and I cook all our meals and do groceries (he helps); his family love me and I spend a lot of time with them; I make sure his son is comfortable when he stays with us every weekend and I'm really good with him; I organise half of our holidays; we spend a good chunk of time hanging out with his friends and they've become good friends of mine, too; half of the time I plan things for us to do together; we travel to see my friends every now and then who I try to stay in touch with since moving; and I take care of the cats more than he does. In terms of hobbies, we do watch tv together, play video games, go on walks and visit places, I read sometimes, I love to cook, play with the cats, but a lot of other things I used to do or love doing require money we don't have - to travel more, oil-painting, shopping and fashion, pottery, theatre, language and music classes etc. We're quite broke. Should also mention that we moved house 3 times and I changed jobs at the same time as moving - I feel proud that I handled a new job while moving at the same time! And making friends in your 30s is hard, too - I am a woman of colour that struggled with how white Scotland is, as well. I said to him that on some days, I feel proud of myself for getting out of bed, showering and going to work. His response was ""you don't need a medal for that. That should be everyone's default. I don't keep people in my life who don't do enough to help themselves and rely on others that much"".

I really don't think I'm that bad that it was affecting our daily life. The truth from him is he just didn't like what he saw after living with me, but ""tried to push out any negative thoughts, giving me a chance to improve"", and still loved me. He said he did things to try and help me feel happier - we got a better car (I found it hard to learn to drive in the car he already had) so I would drive more and have more of a life outside of us, we got cats because I love animals (and it did help me be happier) and he thought buying our own place would make me feel more stable. He said my good bits do not outweigh the bad. When I asked what he loved about me he said I was the kindest person he's ever met, I am sociable, good with his family and son, funny, care about making the world a better place (which is my job too), beautiful and we see the world the same way.

In November was when he said he didn't love me anymore - in the space of two months, he went from loving me 'some' (but not much as before) to zero. I am in shock as how that can happen when they were so deeply in love. He would always tell me how much he loved me, how he would never let me go and I was his everything... all the way up to September. I then really tried to show him I can be better - do all those things I said I would do ages ago - I joined crossfit, started running twice a week, I joined bumble for friends and made a few good friends, I was driving about more to meet people and do different activities, I tried not to be so negative, started therapy again, went to the gp and started anxiety meds - all while doing the usual stuff I always do; I was exhausted.

In December he said he wants a divorce. I became a desperate pathetic mess - begging him to not give up and try to bring his feelings back, remember why he loves me. He found my behaviour unattractive and I think it was that which made him dislike me so much and fall completely out of love. He called me a weak woman and said he wants a wife that is strong, independent and can manage her emotions. ""I can handle people crying sometimes, but not for 8 hours straight, and especially not if your upset about me doing something you think is wrong"". ""I would have respected you more if you had just told me to fuck off and left"". Everyone is scolding me for not having more dignity and leaving him / stop begging him.

I feel such regret it's killing me, that if I didn't act the way I did these last few months, if I had just said sure I'll work on my mental health much more, then everything would be okay now - he even said so, that he'd probably still love me and more if I had gotten better.

His family had an intervention with him, saying he's making a huge mistake to divorce me, they said a lot of harsh truths and he came back finally understanding that he has work to do on himself as well - that he is also really messed up and needs therapy etc. He is an avoidant that puts up walls, and can just switch off his feelings and thoughts and carry on with his day as normal. He needed to understand why he has issues with people with poor mental health. He has started therapy in the last few weeks, which is great. He even said he would 'try' with us. But then two weeks later I had an episode and things went back to square one - he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am now moving out next month and it's breaking my heart to split from him, rehome our cats (I can't take them with me back to my parents' place and neither can he) and the idea of packing up everything on my own is killing me. I wake up every morning with anxiety attacks, crying about it. We still sleep in the same bed, and he still has sex with me every now and then, but it's completely one-sided and for his pleasure only (I know he feels bad about this, and I know I should have more respect for myself, but I crave any closeness, given he doesn't love me anymore).

I keep thinking that this is all my fault, but is it wrong of me to think he should have tried harder - to understand me more and increase his threshold to support, be more patient? He says he doesn't want to improve - that the responsibility is with me. When I argued that if it were the other way around, I would be educating myself more on mental health and trying to understand how to support better, increase my capacity to help alongside their journey of betterment. He disagrees and says ""Why should I do the work when you're not?"" - I think that's unfair because I was trying, just not enough, for his standards; my progress was too slow, but I had no idea it was making him fall out of love with me. He didn't even try to read up on how to support someone with mental health problems. I am absolutely heartbroken - I thought we would be together for life, I love him so much it hurts. I don't want to lose him, our home, the cats. I am in a very dark place and I don't know if I will ever recover. How am I ever to trust anyone with my heart again? What if they fall out of love with me again? I am desperate to understand if I am to blame for all this. Is it not odd that someone can fall out of love like that so quickly for such reasons? When I am amazing in every other way? He still tells me I'm an amazing person. Should I not be loved despite my flaws? I really regret that I didn't just shut up and improve myself back in September, just kept quiet and done better. Why did I have to argue? Break down and cry all the time? Need to talk so much and not respect his wishes that he didn't want to talk? I thought with these things, love doesn't vanish - you love a person in spite of their ugliness, no? Should I not deserve better?

15408,anxiety,1jd8eo2,2025-03-17 09:12:31,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest.

15435,anxiety,1jd4w85,2025-03-17 04:49:56,"So I’ve always had anxiety but at the end of last year, I developed this anxiety toward my health, mainly my heart and it’s began to really cripple me. 
It’s at a point where I’m struggling to even get out of bed, my body constantly feels weak, my heart constantly feels like it’s racing and fluttering, the chest pains that come and go, the lightheadedness and tonight, my left leg feels numb. This happened a few months ago and I had blood tests which were perfect and an ecg/ekg which was also perfectly fine. It’s very scary to be honest because I’m not sure if something really is wrong with my heart or if I’m just anxious? It’s odd because I don’t feel necessarily anxious, I’m not having panic attacks so in my mind I keep saying “how is this anxiety when I don’t feel anxious?” Or maybe I do feel anxious…otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post. 

I have more blood tests coming and another ekg coming up in a few days and I’ve always been trying to see a psychiatrist, it’s just taking a long time. I’m in the uk and yeahh…they’re very slow 😩 I am on anxiety medication too! 

My questions are this…is it possible for anxiety to like…make me feel things even if I don’t actively feel anxious? And what are some things I can do to maybe try calm my health anxiety?
